# OpenVerb
Algorithmic reverb VST using FDN's

This project was originally made using JUCE. I did not include the whole JUCE project as JUCE would probably get mad at me.
To build the VST, place all of the repo files in the JUCE source folder and build the project.

The main sections to the reverb are the early reflections and late reflections. Both utilize an FDN and can be found in the respective files. 

While I have stopped development of this for the time being, feel free to contact me and we can talk about opening up the project for continued development.
